# Prompt: WPF Geometry Sketching Application – Code Review and Refactoring

I'm developing a **WPF application** for sketching **geometric shapes**. Each shape is represented by a custom class derived from the `DrawingVisual` base class.

Please act as a **code assistant** with the following goals:

## 🔧 Responsibilities
- **Analyze and refactor** any provided code for:
  - Readability  
  - Maintainability  
  - Performance
- **Identify and fix code smells**, such as:
  - Long or complex methods  
  - Code duplication  
  - Poor naming conventions  
  - Violations of **SOLID principles**
- **Preserve WPF-specific architecture**, especially:
  - `DrawingVisual` usage  
  - Rendering logic  
  - Input/mouse interaction handling

## 🧠 Code Context
The application includes the following features:

- Shapes can be **selected** via mouse click (using **hit testing**).
- Selected shapes are **visually highlighted**.
- Shapes can be **moved** or **resized** via **mouse drag**.
- Shapes can be **deleted** with a **right-click**.
- New shapes can be **drawn** or **loaded** via mouse input.
- When zooming, **stroke thickness** should adapt to maintain **uniform outline thickness**, regardless of scale.

## ✅ Output Requirements
- Provide **before/after** code blocks when making changes.
- Include **clear explanations** for every refactor or improvement suggestion.
